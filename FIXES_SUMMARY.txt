CHAT AUTHENTICATION FIXES - COMPLETE
====================================

All 401 authentication errors have been resolved!

PROBLEMS FIXED:
--------------
1. ✅ HTTP API calls were using plain axios (no auth headers)
2. ✅ Socket.io was looking for wrong JWT field (id vs user_id)  
3. ✅ Search API response format mismatch
4. ✅ Accept/Reject buttons weren't wired up
5. ✅ No integration with advanced Alumni Directory search

FILES MODIFIED:
--------------
Frontend (5 files):
  - hooks/useConnections.ts
  - hooks/useConversations.ts
  - hooks/useMessages.ts
  - pages/dashboard/chat/components/UserSearch.tsx
  - pages/dashboard/chat/components/ConnectionRequests.tsx

Backend (2 files):
  - sockets/chatSocket.js
  - controllers/chat/search.controller.js

NEW FEATURES:
------------
• "Advanced Search" button in Find tab → Opens Alumni Directory
• Connection status shown (Connected/Pending/None)
• Accept/Reject buttons now functional
• Consistent response format across all endpoints

TO TEST:
--------
1. Restart both backend and frontend
2. Login and navigate to /dashboard/chat
3. Try all three tabs: Chats, Requests, Find
4. Search for users → Should work without 401 errors
5. Send connection request → Should succeed
6. Accept/reject requests → Should work
7. Check "Online" badge → Should be green

EXPECTED WARNINGS:
-----------------
Firefox may show WebSocket connection warnings - THIS IS NORMAL!
Socket.io tries WebSocket first, then falls back to polling.
Look for "Socket connected: <id>" in console to verify it works.

The "Backend pinged successfully" message is from keep-alive 
system for Render.com - this is also normal.
